## Project Overview

### Problem Title
> *[A concise title for your computational solution — e.g., "Library Book Management System" or "Pathfinding Visualiser for Maze Solving"]*

### Computational Context
> *[One sentence naming the area of computer science your solution draws on — e.g., "Object-oriented programming using Python with a SQLite database backend."]*

### Problem Description
> *[2–4 sentences describing the real-world problem you are solving, who it affects, and why a computational solution is appropriate. This should reflect your Criterion A problem scenario.]*

## Success Criteria

These criteria are defined in full in the Criterion A section of the documentation. They are listed here so commit messages can reference them directly (e.g., `TEST: Verify SC-3 handles empty input`).

| ID | Success Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| SC-1 | [e.g., The system allows a user to add, edit and delete records] | 🔲 Not started |
| SC-2 | [e.g., Search returns results in under 2 seconds for a dataset of 1000 entries] | 🔲 Not started |
| SC-3 | [e.g., Invalid inputs are caught and an appropriate error message is displayed] | 🔲 Not started |
| SC-4 | [e.g., The user interface is navigable without prior instruction] | 🔲 Not started |
| SC-5 | [Add as many as your problem requires] | 🔲 Not started |

*Update status as development progresses:* 🔲 Not started → 🔄 In progress → ✅ Complete

| 2 | System design &amp; algorithms finalised | [Date] | `PLAN:` / `DOCS:` |
| 3 | Core functionality built | [Date] | `BUILD:` |
| 4 | Additional features implemented | [Date] | `BUILD:` |
| 5 | Testing &amp; debugging | [Date] | `TEST:` / `FIX:` |
| 6 | Documentation complete | [Date] | `DOCS:` |

## Commit Message Convention

All commits in this repository follow this format:

```
[TYPE]: Brief description of what changed — [SC-reference if applicable]
```

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `PLAN` | Design decisions, diagrams, planning documents added or updated |
| `BUILD` | New feature, function, or component of the product added |
| `FIX` | A bug identified during testing has been corrected |
| `TEST` | Testing evidence added, or code updated in response to a test result |
| `DOCS` | Comments added to code, or IA documentation sections updated |
| `REFACTOR` | Code restructured for clarity or efficiency without changing behaviour |

**Examples:**
```
BUILD: Implement binary search for product lookup — SC-2
FIX: Resolve index out of bounds error in sort function
TEST: Edge case — empty input returns null as expected — SC-3
DOCS: Add inline comments to database connection module
```
